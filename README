it lets you create symlinks that contain environment variables

1. mount dynlinkfs at /mnt/dynlinkfs
2. use mkdynlink

the syntax is like

    % mkdynlink '%{HOME}%S.profile' ./link-to-current-users-profile
    % cat ./link-to-current-users-profile # equivalent to cat "${HOME}/.profile"

(replace slashes with %S, and also %p is the current pid)

development status: i got this basic version working but realized it wouldn't
work for what i was trying to do with it, so i didn't refine it any further

maybe someone will find it useful or interesting regardless
